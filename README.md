#### About
* The Budget Tracker is a project for the U of W Coding Bootcamp Module 19 Challenge.  The project began as starter code and was adjusted until it functioned as intended.

#### Goals
* Edit the starter code so that Users can track withdrawals and deposits with or without an internet connection.
* When the User inputs an expense or deposit, they recieve a notifcation that they have successfully done so.  When the User reestablishes an internet connection, the entries added while offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.
* Use IndexedDB to add offline functionality.
* Create and add service worker
* Create and add a web manifest
* Deploy to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas
